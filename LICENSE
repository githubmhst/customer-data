## **2. Create Tasks in GitHub Project Board**

Since you already have a **GitHub Project** at [Predictive-Analytics Project board](https://github.com/users/githubmhst/projects/3), we’ll add tasks and link them to your repo.

### **Steps**
1. Go to your **Predictive-Analytics Project**.
2. Click **Add item → Add draft issue**.
3. Enter the title, then click **Convert to issue** and select **githubmhst/customer-data** as the repo.
4. Repeat for each task below.

Next, I can prepare a **starter zip package** with this folder structure, placeholder code, and docs so you can just upload it to GitHub without manual typing.  
Do you want me to prepare that package for you?
